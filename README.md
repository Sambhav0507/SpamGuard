# SpamGuard - Message Spam Detection

SpamGuard is a simple Python project that uses the CountVectorizer technique along with Naive Bayes algorithms to detect whether a message is spam or not. This project serves as an example of text classification using machine learning in Python.

## About

### CountVectorizer
CountVectorizer is a text preprocessing technique used to convert a collection of text documents into a numerical feature vector. It works by tokenizing the text and converting it into a matrix of token counts. In the context of spam detection, CountVectorizer helps convert text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand and analyze.

### N-gram Ranges
N-grams are contiguous sequences of N items (words in this case) from a given text or speech. In this project, we use n-gram ranges to capture the relationships between words in the text. For example, a 2-gram (bigram) range would consider pairs of adjacent words, and a 3-gram (trigram) range would consider triples of adjacent words. This helps improve the accuracy of spam detection by considering the context of words.

### Naive Bayes Algorithms
Two types of Naive Bayes algorithms, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, are used for spam detection. These algorithms are based on Bayes' theorem and are commonly used for text classification tasks. Multinomial Naive Bayes is suitable for count-based data like the one generated by CountVectorizer, while Bernoulli Naive Bayes works well for binary data.

## Getting Started

To run the SpamGuard project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpamGuard.git
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Place your dataset in a file named spam.csv in the project directory.

4.Open the Jupyter Notebook SpamGuard.ipynb and run the cells sequentially. This notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and spam detection.

5.Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and test it with your messages.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided in the spam.csv file. It contains labeled examples of both spam and non-spam (ham) messages. The dataset is divided into two columns: text (the message content) and label (0 for ham, 1 for spam).
